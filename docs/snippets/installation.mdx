## Install ControlFlow

Install ControlFlow with your preferred package manager:

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install controlflow 
```

```bash uv
uv pip install controlflow 
```
</CodeGroup>

ControlFlow requires Python 3.9 or greater.
<Warning>
ControlFlow is under active development, so we recommend frequently updating to the latest version to get new features and bug fixes. To upgrade, pass the `-U` flag when installing. 

During early development, there may be breaking changes between versions, so we recommend pinning to a specific version for deployment.
</Warning>

## API Keys

ControlFlow's default LLM is OpenAI's GPT-4o model, which provides excellent performance out of the box. In order to use it, you'll need to provide an API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

ControlFlow supports many other LLM providers as well. To use a different model as your default, or just on a one-off basis, you'll need to install the appropriate packages and provide any required configuration. See the [LLM documentation](/guides/llms) for more information.
