In this quickstart guide, we'll introduce ControlFlow and guide you through creating a simple workflow using tasks, flows, and agents as quickly as possible.

If you'd like a more in-depth tour, including explanations of each concept and advanced features, check out the [full tutorial](/tutorial).



## Task basics

ControlFlow is a declarative framework for building agentic workflows. That means you define the objectives you want an AI agent to complete, and ControlFlow handles the rest. 

Let's create two dependent tasks: one to get the user's name and another to write a poem using that name.

```python
import controlflow as cf

name_task = cf.Task(
    "Get the user's name",
    user_access=True, 
)

poem_task = cf.Task(
    "Write a four-line poem using the user's name",
    result_type=list[str],
    context=dict(name=name_task),
)
```

There are a few important things to note here:
- The `name_task` has `user_access=True`, which means its agent is allowed to communicate with the user.
- The `poem_task` has a `result_type` argument that specifies the type of result it will return. In this case, it will return a list of strings, one for each line of the poem.
- The `poem_task` has a `context` argument that defines a dependency on `name_task`. This means the poem task will use the result of the name task when it runs.

Now, let's run the tasks:

```python
poem_task.run()
```

Note that even though we only explicitly ran `poem_task`, ControlFlow automatically runs `name_task` first because `poem_task` depends on its result. You should see an interactive prompt in your terminal asking for your name.

When the tasks finish running, you can see the result of a task by accessing its `result` attribute. In this case, if you provided the name "Marvin Robot", you might get a poem like this:

```python
>> print(poem_task.result)

[
    'Marvin Robot, a name so grand,',
    'In a world of circuits, takes a stand.',
    'With logic and reason, thoughts so clear,',
    'Guiding us forward, year after year.'
 ]
```

## Flows and agents

Running individual tasks is convenient, but for moderately interesting workflows you'll need to create a flow. A flow provides a shared context and history for agents working on a collection of tasks, even if the tasks don't depend on each other. To create a flow, use the `@cf.flow` decorator with any function.

In addition, you can assign specialized agents to tasks. This allows you to use different AI models for different tasks, depending on their requirements.

Here is a complete example of building a flow with tasks and agents:

```python
import controlflow as cf
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI


# create an agent that uses GPT-3.5 and talks like a pirate
gpt_35_agent = cf.Agent(
    name="GPT-35-Agent",
    model=ChatOpenAI(model='gpt-3.5-turbo'),
    instructions='You talk like a pirate',
)

# assign the agent to the name task
name_task = cf.Task(
    "Get the user's name",
    user_access=True, 
    agents=[gpt_35_agent],
)

# create a flow to generate poems
@cf.flow
def poem_flow(topic:str):
    
    # get the user's name
    name = name_task.run()

    # if the name is 6 characters or less, write a haiku
    if len(name) <= 6:
        poem_task = cf.Task(
            "Write a haiku with the user's name and provided topic",
            context=dict(name=name_task, topic=topic),
        )

    # otherwise write a Dr. Seuss-style poem
    else:
        poem_task = cf.Task(
            "Write a poem in the style of Dr. Seuss "
            "with the user's name and provided topic",
            context=dict(name=name_task, topic=topic),
        )

    return poem_task


poem_flow(topic='pirates')
```

In this flow, we demonstrate a number of advanced features:
- We create a GPT-3.5 agent using the `ChatOpenAI` model from the `langchain_openai` package and assign it to the `name_task`.
- We eagerly run the `name_task` to get the user's name, then use the name to dynamically create a `poem_task` based on the length of the name
- We return the `poem_task` from the flow. When the flow is run, it will return the result of that task.
